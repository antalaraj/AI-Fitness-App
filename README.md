# AI Fitness Planner App 🏋️‍♂️🤖

Smart, Safe, and Personalised Fitness Planning System using Generative AI.

## Overview
AI Fitness Planner App is a full-stack web application that uses Generative Artificial Intelligence to create personalised workout, diet, and mindset plans based on user-specific data. Unlike traditional fitness applications that rely on static templates, this system dynamically generates intelligent fitness guidance using large language models combined with health-based rule logic.

The application analyses user attributes such as age, height, weight, fitness goals, activity level, and dietary preferences to produce safe, realistic, and professional fitness plans.
